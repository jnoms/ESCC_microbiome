This repository containst R scripts that are sufficient to reproduce all analysis in the manuscript "An international report on bacterial communities in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma", International Journal of Cancer 2022 - https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.34212

Notably, there are reproducible google colab documents that can automatically reproduce all analyses! The processed data is present on Zenodo is automatically pulled and plotting using these colab documents, which allows you do interact with and explore the data. Note that the colab documents use "cell magic" to run R instead of Python. Unfortunately, the Google colab version of R updates unpredictably and will deprecate some of the code over time as the language and dependent packages are updated. I couldn't find a way to easily control R versions and package versions using Colab.
